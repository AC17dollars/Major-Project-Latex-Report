\section{\MakeUppercase{Future Enhancements}}

The project has successfully demonstrated the potential of \gls{siren} as a unified model for audio-video compression. However, several areas remain for future exploration and enhancement. These include:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\roman*.}]

    \item \textbf{Dynamic Content Representation:} The current model has shown promising results for static content but struggles with dynamic content. Future work could focus on enhancing the model's ability to represent dynamic content, such as videos with higher \gls{fps}.
    
    \item \textbf{Optimized Quantization:} While the current model achieves competitive results with 16-bit quantization, further optimization of the quantization process could improve compression efficiency without sacrificing quality.
    
\end{enumerate}
